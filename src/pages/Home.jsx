        that training is important for engineering students to enhance their employability skills
        and achieve good placement in various Industries.
        <br/>At present, the competition for employment is increasing every day and placement has
become a challenging task. Training students and equipping them with life skills has
become an important responsibility of the institution. Along with technical expertise,
the development of a holistic personality is also necessary</p>
